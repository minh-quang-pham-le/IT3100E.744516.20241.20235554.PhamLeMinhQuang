  Question 1: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create 
  a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 

  Answer: Yes, Java allows to create multiple constructor methods for a class that can initialize the class in different ways, which is known as constructor overloading.
  This means you can have different constructors in the same class with the same name (the class name), but with different parameter lists (e.g: title and category are two different parameters).
  
  Here is an example of constructor overloading:
  
  public class DigitalVideoDisc {
    public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {
      super(title);
    }

    public DigitalVideoDisc(String title, String category, float cost) {
      super(title, category, cost);
    }
  }
